## ðŸ“– Module Descriptor

### **General Objectives**

This module introduces students to the principles, design patterns, and implementation techniques of microservices and serverless architectures. Students will gain hands-on experience in developing, deploying, and managing distributed systems using modern tools and cloud-native technologies. The module covers the entire lifecycle of microservices and serverless applications, from initial design to production deployment, including inter-service communication, resilience patterns, testing strategies, and observability. By the module's conclusion, students will have a comprehensive understanding of microservices architecture, serverless computing, and the skills to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient distributed systems.

### **Learning Outcomes**

On completion of the module, students will be able to:

1.  Explain the fundamental concepts of microservices and serverless architectures, including their benefits, trade-offs, and appropriate use cases.
2.  Design and implement microservices using gRPC and Protocol Buffers for efficient inter-service communication.
3.  Apply hexagonal architecture principles to create loosely coupled, maintainable microservices.
4.  Implement resilience patterns such as timeout, retry, and circuit breaker to enhance the reliability of distributed systems.
5.  Develop comprehensive testing strategies for microservices, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
6.  Deploy microservices to Kubernetes, implementing various deployment strategies and managing certificates.
7.  Design and implement serverless applications, understanding their event-driven nature and integration patterns.
8.  Implement observability solutions for microservices and serverless applications, including distributed tracing, metrics, and logging.
9.  Evaluate and apply appropriate patterns for data consistency and state management in distributed systems.
10. Analyze and optimize the performance of microservices and serverless applications, addressing common pitfalls and bottlenecks.
